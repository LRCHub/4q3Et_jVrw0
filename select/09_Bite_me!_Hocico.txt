This is the day I pray, pray for you to die
I just don't fucking care
I hope I see you cry tonight
This is the day I bite
I'm going out of control
I'm your place to hide whenever you want to end your life

My sky is turning red
I cannot breathe your air
I hope tonight you choke in the seduction of despair

Send me flowers, I'm fine, hate me!
Everything's alright, bite me!
It's your lovely words and your sweet face
It's the way that you smile
Let me know when you are dying, hate me!

Let me know if you feel
Let me know if you feel the same
Let me know if you feel
Let me know, let me know

Bite me! Hate me!

Bad dreams made you real, this is the way I lived
Bad dreams made you real, but I'm going to finish it
Nightmares are nothing but a beast, a beast that eats you up
Go back to your Hell, suffer your own life
Just make sure you don't breed

Hate me! Bite me! No love lost!
Hate me! Bite me bitch!
All I need now is your hate
Hate

Send me flowers, I'm fine, hate me!
Everything's alright, bite me!
It's your lovely words and your sweet face
It's the way that you smile
Let me know when you are dying, hate me!
