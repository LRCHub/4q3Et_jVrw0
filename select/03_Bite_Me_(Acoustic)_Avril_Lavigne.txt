Ay, you
You should've known better, better to mess with someone like me
Ay, you
Forever and ever you're gonna wish I was your wifey

Don't act so innocent, this was no accident
You planned this in the end and now it's over
Say what you wanna say, you lied and I got played
You threw it all away and now it's over

Just face it, we didn't make it
You bit off more than you could chew, can you taste it?

Ay, you
You should've known better, better to mess with someone like me
Ay, you
Forever and ever you're gonna wish I was your wifey
Should've held on, should've treated me right
I gave you one chance, you don't get it twice
Ay, you
And we'll be together never, so baby, you can bite me

Don't hold your breath
'Cause you're still choking on your words
Those things you said
Might be the last ones that I heard

So come pick up your clothes from the front yard
Sprinklers on burn, the rest in the backyard
Should've had the guts to say goodbye
Now you're gonna have regrets for the rest of your life

Just face it, we didn't make it
You bit off more than you could chew, can you taste it?

Ay, you
You should've known better, better to mess with someone like me
Ay, you
Forever and ever you're gonna wish I was your wifey
Should've held on, should've treated me right
I gave you one chance, you don't get it twice
Ay, you
And we'll be together never, so baby, you can bite me

I bet you taste me on the tip of your tongue
Tip of your tongue, tip of your tongue
I fell fast when I know I should've run
Know I should've run, I know I should've run
I bet you taste me on the tip of your tongue
Tip of your tongue, tip of your tongue
I fell fast when I know I should've run
Know I should've run, I know I should've run

Ay, you
You should've known better, better to mess with someone like me (like me)
Ay, you
Forever and ever you're gonna wish I was your wifey (wifey)
Should've held on, should've treated me right
I gave you one chance, you don't get it twice
Ay, you
And we'll be together never, so baby, you can bite me
